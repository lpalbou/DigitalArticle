# Planning & Historical Documents

This directory contains historical planning documents and design artifacts from the initial development of Digital Article.

## Contents

- **[digital-article-plan.md](digital-article-plan.md)** - Original implementation plan and architecture vision (October 2024)

## Purpose

These documents are preserved to:
- Provide historical context for design decisions
- Show the evolution of the project from initial concept to current implementation
- Help new contributors understand the original vision
- Serve as reference for understanding why certain architectural choices were made

## Note

The current, authoritative documentation is in the parent `docs/` directory:
- [getting-started.md](../getting-started.md) - Installation and tutorial
- [architecture.md](../architecture.md) - Current system design
- [philosophy.md](../philosophy.md) - Design principles and motivation

For the most up-to-date project information, always refer to the main documentation and the root [README.md](../../README.md).
