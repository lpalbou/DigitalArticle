# Digital Article Roadmap

This document outlines the planned development trajectory for Digital Article. The roadmap is organized into time-based phases with priority levels and estimated complexity.

**Last Updated**: January 2025
**Current Version**: 1.0.0 (Beta)

## Guiding Principles

All development follows these principles:
1. **User Experience First**: Features must reduce friction for domain experts
2. **Transparency**: Never sacrifice code visibility for convenience
3. **Scientific Rigor**: Maintain publication-quality output
4. **Extensibility**: Build modular components that enable community contributions
5. **Pragmatism**: Ship working features over perfect architecture

## Release Philosophy

- **Beta (1.x)**: Single-user, research prototype, expect breaking changes
- **Stable (2.x)**: Multi-user ready, production deployment possible
- **Enterprise (3.x)**: Scalable, collaborative, integrated workflows
