# `examples/` (example content, not canonical docs)

This folder contains **example markdown content** that complements the canonical documentation in [`docs/`](../docs/).

## Structure

- [`examples/persona/`](persona/) — persona guidance examples
- [`examples/article/`](article/) — article/scenario examples

Examples are intentionally not the canonical architecture/source-of-truth docs; they exist to help users and contributors learn by example.
