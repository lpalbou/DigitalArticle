# `examples/` (example content, not canonical docs)

This folder contains **example markdown content** that complements the canonical documentation in [`docs/`](../docs/).

## Proof artifacts (what good output looks like)

- **Scientific PDF export**: [`examples/article/Digital_Article_Export_Example.pdf`](article/Digital_Article_Export_Example.pdf)  
  Demonstrates an end-to-end, publication-style report generated from execution (survival analysis with Kaplan–Meier curves, Cox model, and diagnostics).  
  *Note: this example uses synthetic data; do not interpret it as a real clinical claim.*

## Structure

- [`examples/persona/`](persona/) — persona guidance examples
- [`examples/article/`](article/) — article/scenario examples

Examples are intentionally not the canonical architecture/source-of-truth docs; they exist to help users and contributors learn by example.
