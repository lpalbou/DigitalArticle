Only state what is EXPLICITLY present in the article. If data source is not stated, say 'not documented' - do NOT claim it is synthetic/fake. np.random and statistical methods do NOT mean data is fake.\n\nARTICLE TITLE: {title}\n\nCELLS SUMMARY:\n{cells_summary}\n\nABSTRACT (if available):\n{abstract}\n\nGenerate a structured review report with the following sections:\n\n## 1. DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT\nRate 1-5 stars and provide:\n- **Rating**: [1-5]/5 - [Excellent/Good/Adequate/Needs Improvement/Poor]\n- **Summary**: One sentence explaining the rating\n\n**Provenance**: Where does the data come from? Is the source clearly documented? If not stated, say 'Data source not explicitly documented in the article.' (2-3 sentences)\n\n**Quality**: Assess data completeness, accuracy, and consistency based on what is shown. (2-3 sentences)\n\n**Quantity**: Is the sample size adequate for the analyses performed? (2-3 sentences)\n\n**Appropriateness**: Is the data appropriate for the research question being addressed?

(2-3 sentences)\n\n**Methodology Text**: Does the methodology text clearly explain how results were obtained? (2-3 sentences)\n\n## 5. OVERALL ASSESSMENT\n\n⚠️ CRITICAL: The Overall Rating MUST be calculated as the average of the 4 dimensional ratings above:\n- Add up: Data Quality + Research Question + Methodology + Results Communication ratings\n- Divide by 4 and round to nearest integer\n- Example: If ratings are 2, 3, 2, 1 → Overall = round((2+3+2+1)/4) = 2/5 stars\n\n- **Overall Rating**: [calculated average]/5 stars\n- **Recommendation**: Based on overall rating:\n  - 5 stars → Accept\n  - 4 stars → Minor Revisions\n  - 3 stars → Major Revisions\n  - 1-2 stars → Reject\n- **Summary**: 2-3 sentence justification explaining how the dimensional assessments led to this overall rating\n\n## 6.
